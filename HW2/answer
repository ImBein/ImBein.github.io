Question 1.1: Looking at the page containing the table, what are the differences between the DOM as shown by the DOM inspector and the HTML source code? Why would you use the DOM inspector? When is the HTML source useful?
```
DOM inspector shows more HTML elements than HTML source. As of given example, the table is dynamiclly created, without showing in source but in live DOM.   
   
I would use DOM inspector to inspect live HTML DOM tree and elements and thier styles.   
    
HTML source is useful when I need to look up origin tag and attribute those have not been processed by javascript. 

```
Question 1.2: Below we have partially reproduced the first lines from the table's dataset. What piece of software generates this table? Where are the original data stored?
```

It's generated by the script part, i.e. the part that use d3 to append "table" "tr" td", etc.

The original data is stored as a separate JSON file on the server.

Question 2.1: Would you filter other columns from the table the same way? E.g. would you use checkboxes or any other HTML widget?
```

It depends. I would like to use checkboxes, tag input widgets, select2 widgets(bootstrap) etc.

Could you aggregate the table using other columns? If you think yes, explain which ones and how you would group values. Which HTML widgets would be appropriate?
```

Yes. For example, I can aggregate the GDP column by serveral levels
 * less than 1000G
 * less than 10000G
 * 10000G or more

Radiobox or select dropdown would be appropriate.

What are the pros and cons of using HTML vs. SVG? Give some examples in the context of creating visualizations.
```

HTML:
 * pros: 
   * easy to dynamically create and operate (default xmlns)
   * compatible to old browsers
 * cons:
   * hard to represent different vector graphics, e.g. circles or polygons or curves
   
SVG:
  * pros:
    * easy to represent vector graphics
    * can also have events and stylesheets
  * cons:
    * old browsers don't support
